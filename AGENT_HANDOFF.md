## 🎯 RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS

### Immediate Next Task: START PHASE 1
I recommend starting with **Phase 1: Foundation & Security** as it addresses critical issues.

#### Start with Task 1.1: Environment Variables Setup
**Why this first?**
- Security: Removes hardcoded API keys from code
- Foundation: Required for other improvements
- Low risk: Easy to test and verify
- Quick win: Can be done in 15-20 minutes

**What to do:**
1. Open `/app/IMPROVEMENT_ROADMAP.md`
2. Go to "Task 1.1: Environment Variables Setup"
3. Follow the step-by-step instructions
4. Update status in `/app/PROGRESS_TRACKER.md`
5. Test thoroughly before moving to Task 1.2

## 🔍 CODEBASE OVERVIEW

### Architecture:
```
Frontend-Only Application
├─ React 18 + TypeScript
├─ Vite build tool
├─ Firebase Realtime Database
├─ Firebase Anonymous Auth
└─ No backend server (all logic client-side)
```

### Main Features:
- Access code authentication (no email/password)
- Admin panel (quotation/project management)
- Client portal (view quotations/projects)
- PDF invoice generation
- Email integration (EmailJS)
- Analytics dashboard
- Seed data system for testing

### User Access Codes:
- `admin` - Admin panel access
- `testuser1` - John Smith (active projects)
- `testuser2` - Sarah Johnson (new user)
- `testuser3` - Michael Chen (completed projects)

## 🚦 CURRENT ENVIRONMENT STATE

### Installed Dependencies:
```json
"react": "^18.3.1",
"firebase": "^12.4.0",
"react-router-dom": "^6.26.2",
"tailwindcss": "3.4.17",
"vite": "^7.1.10"
// ... see package.json for complete list
```

### Package Manager:
- **Using:** Yarn 1.22.22
- **Warning:** package-lock.json exists (should be removed in Task 1.2)

### Server Process:
```bash
# Check if running:
ps aux | grep vite

# View logs:
tail -f /tmp/vite.log

# Restart if needed:
pkill -f vite && cd /app && yarn dev > /tmp/vite.log 2>&1 &
```

### Environment Issues Found:
1. ⚠️ Firebase config hardcoded in `/app/src/config/firebase.ts`
2. ⚠️ No `.env` file exists
3. ⚠️ API keys exposed in source code
4. ⚠️ Mixed package managers (yarn + npm lockfile)
